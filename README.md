# IK BOT... It's against TOS duh

if it doesn't work.... you're a noob...

or try changing the assets folder, messing with the local imports or confidance values

just `pip install requirements.txt` then run either of the donate or help scripts from the root folder...

the full bot coming soon... probably... maybe... idk
